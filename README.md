## Why OpenClaw?

How OpenClaw compares to other AI agent frameworks:

| Feature | OpenClaw | AutoGPT | CrewAI | LangChain | MetaGPT |
|---------|----------|---------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Config-first (SOUL.md) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| No code required | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Telegram/Slack/Discord built-in | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Multi-agent orchestration | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| MCP (Model Context Protocol) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Self-hosted / local | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Heartbeat monitoring | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Works with Ollama (free) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Production-ready templates | 65 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 3 |
| One-command deploy | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Agent-to-agent communication | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Setup time | ~5 min | ~30 min | ~20 min | ~45 min | ~30 min |

**TL;DR:** OpenClaw is config-first. Write a SOUL.md, run a command, your agent is live. No Python, no chains, no graphs.
